# Revision for trees

1. One reason to use trees might be because you want to store information that naturally forms a hierarchy. For example, the file system on a computer:

```bash
file system
-----------
     /    <-- root
  /      \
...       home
      /          \
   ugrad        course
    /       /      |     \
  ...      cs101  cs112  cs113  
```
2. Trees (with some ordering e.g., BST) provide moderate access/search (quicker than Linked List and slower than arrays).

3. Trees provide moderate insertion/deletion (quicker than Arrays and slower than Unordered Linked Lists).

4. Like Linked Lists and unlike Arrays, Trees donâ€™t have an upper limit on number of nodes as nodes are linked using pointers.

## Binary Tree
A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.
