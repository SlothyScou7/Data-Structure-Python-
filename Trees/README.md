# Revision for Trees

1. One reason to use trees might be because you want to store information that naturally forms a hierarchy. For example, the file system on a computer:

```bash
file system
-----------
     /    <-- root
  /      \
...       home
      /          \
   ugrad        course
    /       /      |     \
  ...      cs101  cs112  cs113  
```
2. Trees (with some ordering e.g., BST) provide moderate access/search (quicker than Linked List and slower than arrays).

3. Trees provide moderate insertion/deletion (quicker than Arrays and slower than Unordered Linked Lists).

4. Like Linked Lists and unlike Arrays, Trees donâ€™t have an upper limit on number of nodes as nodes are linked using pointers.

## Binary Tree


A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.

Full Binary Tree -> A Binary Tree is a full binary tree if every node has 0 or 2 children.

Complete Binary Tree -> Every level is filled to fullest except the last level. 

Perfect Binary Tree -> All levels filled completely.

Balanced Binary Tree -> A binary tree is balanced if the height of the tree is O(Log n) where n is the number of nodes.

## Enumeration in Binary Trees

Number of possible unordered binary tree woth n nodes -> Sum(T(i-1)*T(n-i)) From i=1 to n.

Number of BST with n nodes is also same as unordered trees.

Labeled Binary trees with N nodes = Number of unlabeled * n! (all labels are different)
